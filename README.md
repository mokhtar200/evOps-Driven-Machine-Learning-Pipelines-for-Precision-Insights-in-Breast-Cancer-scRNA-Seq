# DevOps-Driven-Machine-Learning-Pipelines-for-Precision-Insights-in-Breast-Cancer-scRNA-Seq

This project aims to build a robust, reproducible machine learning pipeline for analyzing single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data in the context of breast cancer. We will leverage DevOps principles for version control, containerization, and continuous integration (CI), and use machine learning to extract precision insights from the data.

Goals of the Analysis:
Quality control of the raw scRNA-Seq data
Preprocessing (filtering, normalization)
Dimensionality reduction and clustering of cell types
Differential expression analysis
Development of predictive models using machine learning to understand gene expression patterns in cancer subtypes
Integration with clinical data for deeper insights
2. Pre-requisites:
Make sure you have the following installed:

R (and key packages like Seurat, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse) (for machine learning scripts)
Docker (for containerization)
Git (for version control)
CI/CD tool (like GitHub Actions)
Jupyter (for notebooks)
awscli (if you plan to work with cloud storage)
